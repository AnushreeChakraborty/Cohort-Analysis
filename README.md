# Cohort-Analysis
The Online Retail dataset was taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was used for the cohort analysis. 
The cohort index and cohort month were used to show the retention rates, which is the percentage of the users that the company has retained over a given period of time starting from the assigned cohort. 
The pivot table obtained shows that as time increases the retention rate is seen to decrease. 
The heatmap of the above result shows the retention rates decreasing. The main aim is to identify the reasons behind the decreasing retention rates.
